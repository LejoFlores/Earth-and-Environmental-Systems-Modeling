    "In this part of the assignment, your task is to create a one-dimensional random walk model similar to the one in [the example notebook](./mod01-PythonIntro-1.ipynb) with the following parameters:\n",
    "\n",
    "* `Nt` = 200\n",

    "\n",
    "Where `min_x` is a new parameter that is the _minimum step size_ at each step in the random walk. When you calculate the step size at each step, you will only accept values that are larger than `min_x` by using a `while` loop to keep generating step sizes until the step size exceeds `min_x`. Do this for `Nx` = 1,000 random walkers. \n",
