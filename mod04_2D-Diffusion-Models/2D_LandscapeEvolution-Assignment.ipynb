    "# Module 04: Assignment for 2-Dimensional Landscape Evolution Model\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview and Requirements\n",
    "\n",
    "In this assignment you will examine the long term behavior of the elevation field under two different assumptions about the landscape diffusivity (i.e., the variable controlling soil creep). Use the code below to conduct the following experiments:\n",
    "\n",
    "__Experiment 1:__ Using the code below conduct an experiment that leaves everything unchanged, except `tf` which you should increase to 100,000 yrs and increasing the plotting output interval (`OutputInterval`) to 20,000 years. Run the model and also create an array that is `Nt` in length to store the maximum elevation in the 2-D domain at each time step. You will need to use the `.max` function on `hnext` to obtain this inside the main `for` loop of the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "__Experiment 2:__ Using the same setup as you did for Experiment 1 above, now _decrease_ the diffusivity `D` by an order of magnitude and re-run the model, again keeping track of the maximum elevation in the domain at each modeling time step. \n",
    "\n",
    "The notebook you turn in should have the following plots:\n",
    "* The maximum elevation versus time for both experiments on the same plot\n",
    "* The 3D plot containing topographic surfaces at every 20,000 year interval for __Experiment 1__ (clearly labelled)\n",
    "* The 3D plot containing topographic surfaces at every 20,000 year interval for __Experiment 2__ (clearly labelled)\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer the following question:\n",
    "* How does changing the diffusivity change the evolution of the maximum elevation in each experiment? \n",
    "* If we were to allow Experiments 1 and 2 to run for an infinite amount of time, how would the topographic surface between the experiments? What would be the only difference between the two topographies?"
