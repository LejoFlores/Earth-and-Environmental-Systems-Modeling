# Semester Term Project Description

## I. Purpose
The purpose of this modeling project is for you to explore an existing model of interest to your professional development and/or research. 

## II. Description and Overview
During this project you will: 

1. Select a model for further study based on your interests, research projects, or pure curiosity, 
2. Examine key details of the Earth and environmental processes that it models in the context of topics we cover in the class,
3. Review the required data needed to set up initial and boundary conditions for the model,
4. Investigate procedures and data needs for calibration/validation, and 
5. Design a numerical experiment to test a scientific hypothesis or perform a specific analysis. 

Note: ___You will not need to setup, run, or perform your numerical experiment as a requirement of the project.___ However, this project could be a valuable tool to kickstart any modeling activities required for your thesis or dissertation. As such, I ___highly___ encourage you to consult with your advisor(s) and me when choosing a model. 

## III. Requirements
This project will be submitted as a Markdown (e.g., `PROJECT.md`) file in your GitHub repository for the class. Other acceptable formats include Jupyter Notebooks with extensive Markdown editing and PDF files generated in LaTeX. In any case, the URL where your final writeup is posted in your GitHub repo for the class is what will be submitted. 

The report itself __must__ have the sections outlined below. Subsections may be used if needed, but should be numbered hierarchically within a section (e.g., the first subsection within section 3, should be 3.1) and should be labeled or titled. Based on the guidelines for length, the complete writeup would be no more than ~5-10 pages of 1.5 spaced text.

            <td>1. Introduction</td>
            <td>Describe the scientific or engineering challenge for which the model will be used. The problem should be contemporary or have context which makes an old problem contemporary (e.g., using older models in areas with limited data). Reference studies that are relevant and contemporary.</td>

            <td>2. Model Description</td>
            <td>Describe the model being profiled or examined. The description should be accurate and clearly link to processes overviewed in the class. You should present previous uses of the model for applications similar to those described in the Introduction and cite those studies. Where possible, include a conceptual figure of the model, ensuring to cite it appropriately if it is not your original work.</td>

            <td>3. Data Needs</td>
            <td>Provide an overview of the data required as input to the model and the output data variables and the data format. If possible or appropriate based on the model, provide specific references to appropriate sources of input datasets. If multiple alternative input datasets are mentioned, include a brief compare and contrast of these datasets.</td>

        <tr>
            <td>4. Calibration</td>
            <td>List the variables/parameters in the model that require calibration as appropriate to the problem identified. Identify the target variables and observational datasets that would be needed to characterize model performance. If possible, provide examples of prior, similar calibration studies.</td>

            <td>5. Numerical Experiment Design</td>
            <td>Describe the proposed numerical experiment in the context of the scientific or engineering challenge that is presented in the Introduction. This could be presented, for example, as a hypothesis about what your numerical experiments will show. Provide a rationale for this experiment – a justification as to why this experiment will answer the challenge or question you posed. If you based your experiments on previous studies, identify clearly how your experiment extends or enhances previous experiments. Conceptual figures and tables are particularly helpful in demonstrating numerical experiment design.</td>
