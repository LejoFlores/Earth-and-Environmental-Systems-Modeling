# Module 02 Code: Box Modeling

## Content

This folder contains notebooks for Module 02 in GEOS 518: Modeling Earth and Environmental Systems. This module deals with creating box or toy models of dynamical systems. There are two notebooks of note in this folder:

* [mod02-CarbonModel1.ipynb](./mod02-CarbonModel1.ipynb): An example notebook of a model of carbon exchange between the atmosphere and biosphere. The model is based on that outlined in Slingerland and Kump Chapter 3. The notebook works but is lacking comments, requiring the student to run the code and use comments and Markdown cells to explain the model.
* [mod02-CarbonModel-Assignment.ipynb](./mod02-CarbonModel-Assignment.ipynb): An assignment notebook that takes the model from above and extends it to examine how the coupled system responds when forced by anthropogenic carbon emissions injected into the atmosphere from 1751-2008. The assignment then requires the students to evaluate how the system responds to emissions mitigation scenarios between 2008-2100 that include: (1) net zero emissions by 2030, (2) net zero emissions by 2050, and (3) capped and constant emissions
